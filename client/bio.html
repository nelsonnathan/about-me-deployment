        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div>
            I am a student at the University of Utah, studying Computer Science. I'm also enrolled at 
            DevMountain, working to increase my technical abilities to aid in the pursuit of a career
            in software engineering. 
            I am always ready for new challenges and constructive feedback. I'm open minded and learn quickly.
            I want to become a team player and dedicate my skills and talents toward developing high quality 
            products.
